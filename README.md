# Firebase Authentication with GetX

## Overview
This Flutter application demonstrates the integration of **Firebase Authentication** with **GetX** for state management. It is designed with a clean and maintainable architecture, adhering to **SOLID principles**. The project structure is organized into two main folders: **core** and **screens**.

### Project Structure
```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart             # Entry point of the app
â”œâ”€â”€ my_app.dart           # Root widget of the application
â”œâ”€â”€ core/                 # Core functionality and shared resources
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/           # App-routes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ constants/        # App-wide constants (e.g., colors, styles)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/         # Firebase and API-related services
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ repository/       # Data handling and business logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ widgets/          # Reusable UI components
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils/            # Helper functions and utilities
â””â”€â”€ screens/              # Application screens
    â”œâ”€â”€ login/            # Login screen
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ controller/   # GetX controller for login logic
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ view/         # UI for the login screen
    â”œâ”€â”€ sign_up/          # Signup screen
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ controller/   # GetX controller for signup logic
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ view/         # UI for the signup screen
    â””â”€â”€ home/             # Home screen
        â”œâ”€â”€ controller/   # GetX controller for home logic
        â””â”€â”€ view/         # UI for the home screen
```

This structure ensures separation of concerns, making the project scalable and easy to maintain.
